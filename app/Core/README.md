### app/Core

This directory is the framework of our app. It houses the application's container for dependency injection, which is a
key part of our code's flexibility. It also contains the context for storing data that's specific to each request.

In addition, you'll find a DTO (Data Transfer Objects) and a model interfaces here. These are crucial for keeping our
data organized and well-structured.

This directory also takes care of exception handling, HTTP request and response handling, the application kernel,
logging, middleware, rendering, and routing. Essentially, it's the central hub for many of the application's most
important operations.
