### app/Dto

This directory is where we keep all the Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) for our app. DTOs are simple objects that turn raw
requests into PHP objects. This object implements validation from users' requests, helps us keep our code clean, and
lets data move easily across different parts of the app. Itâ€™s a smart way to manage data in our app.
