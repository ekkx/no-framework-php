### Feature Test

**Feature Tests** (also known as functional tests or end-to-end tests) involve testing a complete functionality of the
application. It's more about testing the system as a whole rather than testing individual components.

In the context of this project, a feature test might involve testing the interaction of several repositories, services, and
controllers together to see if they correctly perform a certain function or feature of the application.

Feature tests simulate real user scenarios, typically involving interaction with a database. They can help to identify
issues in the integration between components and layers of the application.
